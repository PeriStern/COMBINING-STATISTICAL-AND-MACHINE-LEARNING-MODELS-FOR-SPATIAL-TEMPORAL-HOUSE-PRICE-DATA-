This project was developed for my master’s thesis, as part of my MSc in Data Analytics at the University of Glasgow. It uses data from the Scottish government’s official statistics publication (Scottish Government, 2018)\
The data has spatial-temporal correlation, and this project aims to model the data to predict the house prices ahead in time. This project uses CAR and RF models for the prediction and combines the two for better prediction.  

Lists of methods uses:\
Linear model\
MCMC linear and anova\
INLA \
RF\
CAR RF for spatial data\
CAR RF for spatial temporal data
