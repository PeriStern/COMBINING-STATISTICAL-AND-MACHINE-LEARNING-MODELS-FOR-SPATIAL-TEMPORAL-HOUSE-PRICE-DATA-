Combining Statistical and Machine Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal House Price Data
---

This project was developed for my master’s thesis, as part of my MSc in Data Analytics at the University of Glasgow. It uses data from the Scottish government’s official statistics publication (Scottish Government, 2018)\
The data has spatial-temporal correlation, and this project aims to model the data to predict the house prices ahead in time. This project uses CAR and RF models for the prediction and combines the two for better prediction.\ 
This contains the r code used for analysis and the presentation as used for the thesis defence
